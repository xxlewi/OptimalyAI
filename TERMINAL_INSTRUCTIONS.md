git rebase origin/main
```

### During Development
```bash
# Check your changes
git status

# Stage and commit regularly
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/ai-tools-[your-phase]
```

### Handling Conflicts
```bash
# If conflicts occur during rebase
git status  # See conflicted files
# Resolve conflicts in editor
git add [resolved-files]
git rebase --continue
```
